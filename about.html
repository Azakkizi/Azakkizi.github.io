        <p>I am a senior in computer engineering at Istanbul University Cerrahpasa.
          <br> My interest in computers since I was 3 years old was the biggest factor
          <br> in my decision to become a computer engineer instead of an architect.
          <br> Both at school and through my own resources, I don't just limit what
          <br> I learn to theory, but also put it into practice.
          <br> <br> The reason I started using computers at the age of 3 was because 
          <br> I played computer games on my older brother's computer. In my free time, 
          <br> I both play computer games and try to develop them.</p>
